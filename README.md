# Lab 2: Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket and Uploading a File

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll learn how to create an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket and upload a file to it. Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service provided by AWS that allows you to store and retrieve data.

By following these detailed instructions, you'll be able to complete the lab successfully, even if you have no prior experience with AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: If you don't have an AWS account, you can create one for free by following this [guide](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Sign in to AWS Console

1. Open your web browser and visit the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Sign in to your AWS account using your credentials.

### Step 2: Access the S3 Dashboard

3. After logging in, you'll be on the AWS Management Console. In the top menu, click on "Services."
4. Under the "Storage" section, find and click on "S3" (Simple Storage Service). You'll be taken to the S3 Dashboard.

### Step 3: Create an S3 Bucket

5. In the S3 Dashboard, click the "Create bucket" button to start creating a new S3 bucket.
6. Choose a unique and descriptive name for your bucket. Keep it simple and all lowercase, as bucket names must be globally unique.
7. Choose the AWS region where you want to create the bucket. Select the one nearest to you or leave it as the default region.
8. Click the "Create" button to create your S3 bucket.

### Step 4: Upload a File

10. Inside the bucket, click the "Upload" button to upload a file.
11. Click "Add files" or "Add folder" to select the file you want to upload from your computer.
12. Select the file and click "Next" or "Open."
13. For permissions, you can leave them as default for simplicity.
14. Keep clicking "Next" until you reach the "Review" page.
15. Review your settings and click "Upload" to upload the file to your S3 bucket.

### Step 5: Access the Uploaded File

16. Once the file is successfully uploaded, you'll see it listed in your S3 bucket.
17. To view the file, simply click on its name. This will open a preview of the file.
18. You can also select the file, click "Actions," and choose options like "Open," "Download," or "Delete."

## Conclusion
